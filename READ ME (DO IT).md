You'll learn to build a Payment Landing Page for a fictional Payment App and create a design based off of a Figma design file.

- Show hover effect for all interactable elements (Basic colour changes, scale animations, shadows, etc)
- Write the code (both HTML and CSS in a way that is easily readable and maintainable)
- Make it look as close to the design file as possible, keeping in mind that the design file was made in a 1440px wide environment, whereas your device will be have a width of 1920px. This should mean that there is blank space on either side of the content.
